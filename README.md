# VANET-Dynamic-Graph

## Overview
In this project, a dynamic time-based graph is created using the OMNeT++ 5.6.2 and Veins 5.2 frameworks for vehicular communications.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a vehicular network simulation based on dynamic, time-based graphs. It aims to explore and optimize communication and data transmission between vehicles in a simulated environment.
