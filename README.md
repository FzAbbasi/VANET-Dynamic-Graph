# VANET-Dynamic-Graph

## Overview
In this project, a dynamic time-based graph is created.  using OMNeT++ 5.6.2 and Veins 5.2 framework for vehicular communications.This repository implements simulations using OMNeT++ 5.6.2 and Veins 5.2 framework for vehicular communications.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a vehicular network simulation based on dynamic, time-based graphs. The project aims to explore and optimize communications between vehicles in a simulated environment.
